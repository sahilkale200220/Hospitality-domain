# Power BI Project: Hospitality Domain Analysis
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) in the hospitality industry, specifically in hotels. The project aims to provide insights and recommendations for business growth based on the analysis of various metrics such as REVPAR, ADR, DSRN, DURN, DBRN, occupancy %, realisation %, and revenue. The report includes visualizations presented on a weekly and monthly basis, allowing directors and managers to assess performance trends over time and make data-driven decisions.

## Introduction
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of key metrics in the hospitality domain, allowing directors and managers to monitor and improve business performance. The visualizations and interactive features provide insights into revenue, occupancy rates, room category performance, and other important indicators.

## Data
The project utilizes three months of hotel data to generate meaningful visualizations and reports. The dataset contains information such as room bookings, revenues, room categories, cities, and other relevant data points. The data is securely stored and processed within Power BI to ensure privacy and confidentiality.

## Features
The Power BI report offers the following features:

REVPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Visualizations showing REVPAR trends and comparisons between different time periods.

ADR (Average Daily Rate): Analysis of average daily rates, enabling managers to identify pricing opportunities and optimize revenue.

DSRN (Double-Occupancy Room Nights): Monitoring the occupancy rate of double-occupancy rooms to ensure optimal utilization.

DURN (Double-Occupancy Room Nights): Analysis of the duration of double-occupancy room stays to understand guest behavior and preferences.

DBRN (Double-Occupancy Bed Room Nights): Visualizations highlighting the performance of double-occupancy bed rooms.

Occupancy %: A comprehensive view of occupancy rates, enabling managers to assess room availability and potential revenue loss.

Realisation %: Analysis of realisation rates, providing insights into the efficiency of revenue generation compared to the maximum potential revenue.

Revenue: Revenue breakdown by various factors such as room categories, cities, and time periods.
Filters: Interactive filters allowing users to customize the analysis by selecting specific cities, room categories, or time ranges.
